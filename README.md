The goal of this project is to create a prototype of a hospital kiosk/desktop application for patients, visitors, and staff at Brigham & Women’s Hospital. The application is designed to run on large screen kiosks and desktop computers throughout the hospital. The application features three main functions with additional features for visitors, staff and administrator users.
	The first main function of the application is providing pathfinding to the users. A user can navigate within the main campus of Brigham and Women’s Hospital, as well as the Faulkner campus and between the campuses. Users are able to change their starting location and their destination, and a path, along with written step-by-step directions, are generated for the user. The user may specify a step, which will bring the user to where on the map that step occurs in the process of pathfinding to their destination. 
	The second main function of the application is to provide administrators with the capability to edit the map that is utilized for navigation by the users. Administrators may add nodes that can function as rooms, hallways, stairs or elevators. Administrators also may also connect these nodes or designate a node to be leveraged as a transition edge between floors.
	The third main function of the application provides users with the ability to make a request for service. Users can make a service request for: 
Audio/Visual Services
Candy Store
Dr. Appointment
Florist Deliver
Food Ordering
Information Technology
Internal Transportation
Language Interpreter
Medicine Delivery (administrator only)
Religious Services
Sanitations Services
Birthday Party

Service requests are sent to an admin database where they await approval, and not all service requests are available to visitors.
There are three types of user credentials: visitors, staff and administrators. Visitors and Staff may navigate and request a service. Administrators have the additional ability to edit maps and approve and deny service requests.
